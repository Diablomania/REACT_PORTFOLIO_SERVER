# REACT_PORTFOLIO_SERVER
This is a sever side of my REACT_PORTFOLIO project.
It based on node.js and express.
For now it pretty simple, it just get direct POST (method) request and give some JSON response.
In next versions it must learn to get some info from SQL Database and return it to the frontend side.
It must lern, how to sort DataBase info by some "filters".
